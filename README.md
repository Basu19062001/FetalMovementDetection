Introduction

Maternal health, encompassing pregnancy, child- birth, and the immediate postpartum period, is critical to global healthcare. In economically disad- vantaged countries, inadequate treatment and ed- ucation contribute significantly to maternal mor- tality. Hypertension during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, poses substantial risks. Routine pre- natal appointments, crucial for monitoring and managing maternal health, involve nutritional reg- ular exercise planning, alongside medical assess- ments like fetal heart rate monitoring, blood pres- sure checks, weight measurements, fundal height assessments, and urine testing, is essential. Rou- tine medical evaluations and tracking fetal move- ments help in early detection of potential health is- sues.In rural areas, lack of awareness and financial constraints often limit access to necessary medical care, with the high cost of ultrasonic scanning de- vices being a significant barrier. IoT technology offers a promising solution by transforming conven- tional healthcare tools into intelligent, connected systems through embedded devices, communication protocols, sensor networks, and applications. This integration facilitates seamless collection, manage- ment, and sharing of healthcare information, in- cluding diagnosis, treatment, recovery, inventory, and medication.The proposed system uses various sensors, including an accelerometer for monitoring fetal movements. Data from these sensors is com- municated through an Arduino Uno and IoT tech- nology to a software program accessible via mo- bile devices or PCs. Graphical data is displayed on an LCD, with alerts for abnormal values, en- abling timely intervention and improving maternal health outcomes. This innovative approach lever- ages technology to revolutionize traditional health- care practices, enhancing accessibility and effective- ness. Fetal monitoring, a cornerstone of prenatal care, predominantly uses ultrasound methods like fetal echocardiography (fECHO) and cardiotocog- raphy (CTG).
However, CTG’s sensitivity to noise from maternal movements necessitates frequent repositioning of ultrasound transducers. Alternative methods such as fetal electrocardiography (fECG), phonocardio- graphy (fPCG), and magnetocardiography (fMCG) provide unique insights into fetal heart activity, each with distinct advantages and challenges.

Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a compre- hensive system for tracking fetal movement in the womb, crucial for monitoring the health and devel- opment of the baby. By employing ADXL335 and MPU6050 [3] sensors, detailed data on the move- ments of both the mother and the fetus can be col- lected. These sensors measure acceleration along the x, y, and z axes, providing comprehensive infor- mation about the dynamic environment inside the womb. The primary aim is to distinguish between the mother’s movements and those of the fetus us- ing machine learning algorithms, thereby enabling precise monitoring of fetal activity.
1.	Sensors and Data Collection: Utilizing the ADXL335 [4] and MPU6050 sensors, which offer analog and digital output signals respectively, in conjunction with an Arduino UNO, real-time data on intrauterine movements can be captured. This data is then transmitted to a cloud-based platform such as ThingSpeak for storage and analysis.
2.	Data Transmission and Preprocessing: The collected sensor data is processed using the Ar- duino UNO to ensure accuracy and reliability. Sub- sequently, the raw data is transmitted to ThingS- peak [5] for real-time collection and visualization. Preprocessing steps involve noise filtering, data nor- malization, and segmentation into meaningful time windows to facilitate further analysis.
3.	Machine Learning for Movement Classifi- cation:
•	Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed sensor data, potentially including statistical measures.
•	Data Labeling: Initially, a portion of the data is manually labeled to differentiate be- tween maternal and fetal movements, forming the ground truth dataset for training the ma- chine learning models. [6]
