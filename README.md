Introduction
Maternal health, encompassing pregnancy, child- birth, and the immediate postpartum period, is critical to global healthcare. In economically disad- vantaged countries, inadequate treatment and ed- ucation contribute significantly to maternal mor- tality. Hypertension during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, poses substantial risks. Routine pre- natal appointments, crucial for monitoring and managing maternal health, involve nutritional reg- ular exercise planning, alongside medical assess- ments like fetal heart rate monitoring, blood pres- sure checks, weight measurements, fundal height assessments, and urine testing, is essential. Rou- tine medical evaluations and tracking fetal move- ments help in early detection of potential health is- sues.In rural areas, lack of awareness and financial constraints often limit access to necessary medical care, with the high cost of ultrasonic scanning de- vices being a significant barrier. IoT technology offers a promising solution by transforming conven- tional healthcare tools into intelligent, connected systems through embedded devices, communication protocols, sensor networks, and applications. This integration facilitates seamless collection, manage- ment, and sharing of healthcare information, in- cluding diagnosis, treatment, recovery, inventory, and medication.The proposed system uses various sensors, including an accelerometer for monitoring fetal movements. Data from these sensors is com- municated through an Arduino Uno and IoT tech- nology to a software program accessible via mo- bile devices or PCs. Graphical data is displayed on an LCD, with alerts for abnormal values, en- abling timely intervention and improving maternal health outcomes. This innovative approach lever- ages technology to revolutionize traditional health- care practices, enhancing accessibility and effective- ness. Fetal monitoring, a cornerstone of prenatal care, predominantly uses ultrasound methods like fetal echocardiography (fECHO) and cardiotocog- raphy (CTG).
However, CTGâ€™s sensitivity to noise from maternal movements necessitates frequent repositioning of ultrasound transducers. Alternative methods such as fetal electrocardiography (fECG), phonocardio- graphy (fPCG), and magnetocardiography (fMCG) provide unique insights into fetal heart activity, each with distinct advantages and challenges.

Motivation
The journey of motherhood, imbued with the antic- ipation of new life and inherent risks, underscores the paramount importance of monitoring maternal and fetal health. While traditional methods hold value, their limitations in timeliness and compre- hensiveness necessitate innovative solutions. The emergence of wearable Artificial Intelligence (AI)
[1] and Internet of Things (IoT) [2] technologies sig- nals a transformative shift in maternal healthcare, promising substantial advancements in monitoring and safeguarding maternal and fetal well-being. Research endeavors aimed at revolutionizing mater- nal and fetal health monitoring through wearable AI and IoT technologies address persistent chal- lenges in maternal care globally. Despite medical advancements, high maternal mortality rates per- sist, particularly in underserved regions where pre- ventable complications during pregnancy and child- birth claim numerous lives annually. Existing fetal health monitoring techniques often lack precision and real-time insights necessary for early interven- tion.
The integration of wearable AI and IoT technolo- gies seeks to surmount these challenges, promot- ing proactive and personalized maternal healthcare. Wearable devices equipped with AI algorithms can continuously monitor vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and fetal movements, provid- ing real-time data insights into maternal and fetal health.
These insights, coupled with advanced analytics, empower healthcare providers to detect potential complications early, facilitating timely interven- tions and improving outcomes.
By revolutionizing maternal and fetal health moni- toring, researchers endeavor to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates while enhancing the overall pregnancy experience on a global scale. The inte- gration of wearable AI and IoT technologies into maternal healthcare represents a significant stride towards personalized and proactive care for expec- tant mothers. Embracing these innovations holds the potential to revolutionize maternal and fetal health monitoring, ultimately saving lives and en- hancing the pregnancy experience for women world- wide. As the pursuit of safer and more inclusive maternal healthcare advances, a steadfast commit- ment to innovation, compassion, and healthier fu- tures for all mothers and their unborn children re- mains imperative.
